<b>购买一个或多个完整的Key</b><br>
- 为购买的每把钥匙在计时器上加30秒，最高可达24小时的硬顶；<br>
- 如果时间结束，<span class=popoverrightmini>你</span>是最后一个购买完整的Key的人，那么<span class=popoverrightmini>你</span>就赢得“exit-scam”游戏；
<br>
- 你拥有的每把<b>Key</b>也会抽取并锁定部分游戏里流通的所有以太坊，并将其直接存入你的余额；<br />
- <b class="tooltipyellow"> 在回合结束时</b>，你的Key会自动保证你有大量的“sxit-scam”块，游戏结束时返回！
<br><br>
- 最后，价格自然会随着时间的延长而价值上涨，鼓励早买入，每次结束只有一个exit scam结束！

您可以认定自己是最终的赢家，或者购买大量的Keys，并随着游戏的继续而分红。<br />

Keys naturally siphon and lock up bits of ethereum as the round goes on. The more keys you own, the more they siphon off into <span class=popoverrightmini>your</span> wallet! Specially at the very end! <br>
<b>On Lockdown</b> is a quick estimate of how much eth your keys have locked up for you so far, that will be availible the instant the round ends!

Along with a pretty timer you can follow along to know exactly how many moments you have left before <b> your own internal fomo kicks in</b> and you buy another key to wrest control of the exit scam away from thy enemies. 
<br>

It also tells you neat important things about the game

The total amount of eth contributed during the ICO phase is used to buy keys from the contract in one lump sum when the ICO timer ends.

Every early investor recieves keys as if they had paid the average price-per-key. This guarantees everyone the same and cheapest price-per-key possible during each round.

Sending eth to the smart contract creates and deposits new tokens automatically into your wallet
<br> sending P3D tokens to the smart contract pays you immediately in ETH, and destroys the tokens.

The contract stores all ETH ever sent to it, effectively backing all the tokens similar to having gold back a physical currency. If you ever need to sell, the contract will buy from you right away with 100% liquidity.

The concept of selling, or proving you have weak hands. Incurs a 10% tax and pays it out to everyone still holding the token.
<br>
<br>
The token itself is designed around psychological warfare in this sense, encouraging players to trick one another into selling to simultaneously make it easier to scoop up many tokens for cheaper, while paying out eth to everyone who doesn't sell. Making "Hodl" less of a meme and more of a real profitable strategy, as holding the token until it crashes guarantees you large amounts of ethereum in dividends.
<br>
<br>
The opposite of how the rest of the cryptocurrency space works. We enjoy making IRONIC and fully functional concepts that break the comfortable strategies of standard cryptocurrency.
